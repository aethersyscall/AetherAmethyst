# Contributing to AetherAmethyst

I am thrilled that you want to help expand this universe.

I designed **AetherAmethyst** as a visual philosophy, but I cannot personally build it for every tool in existence. I am an expert in some areas, but **you** are the expert in yours. whether that's Emacs, IntelliJ, Windows Terminal, or Slack.

I need you to take this palette and adapt it to the tools you love.

## 🛠 The Decentralized Model

I don't want to micromanage your code. I want you to own it.

We use a **Federated** contribution model. This means:
1.  **You create your own repository** (e.g., `aether-amethyst-vscode` or `aether-amethyst-bat`).
2.  **You maintain it.** You are the "Star" of that port.
3.  **I link to it.** Once you are ready, you submit a PR to *this* repository to be listed in our official Ecosystem.

## 🎨 The Design Guidelines (The Iron Rules)

While I want you to own the code, **I am strict about the colors.**

AetherAmethyst is not just "purple." It is a specific psychological environment. If you introduce random colors, you break the trance. To keep your port official, I ask that you follow these rules:

### 1. No Earth Tones.
This is the most important rule.
*   **Do not use** standard Orange, Brown, Yellow, or Leaf Green. They feel too "organic" and "muddy" for this aesthetic.
*   If your tool needs **Yellow**, use **Gold (`#E0AF68`)** or **Orchid**.
*   If your tool needs **Green**, use **Teal** or **Cyan (`#80FFEA`)**.
*   If your tool needs **Red**, use **Magenta** or **Neon Pink (`#FF70B8`)**.

### 2. Respect the Environments.
*   **Eclipse (Dark Mode):**
    *   Do not use pure black (`#000000`). It is too harsh. Use the specific Void Indigo (`#13111B`) I provided.
    *   Use the **Neon Pastel** variant of the palette. The text needs to "glow" against the background.
*   **Bliss (Light Mode):**
    *   Do not use pure white (`#FFFFFF`). It hurts the eyes. Use the Paper Lavender (`#FDF7FF`) background.
    *   **Do not just invert the dark colors.** You must use the **Jewel Tone** variant. If you use the neon pastels on a light background, they will be invisible. I specifically tuned the Jewel Tones to have high contrast on white.

## 🚀 How to Submit Your Port

Once you have built your theme and it looks beautiful:

1.  **Fork this repository.**
2.  Open the `README.md` file.
3.  Add a new row to the **Official Constellation** table:
    ```markdown
    | **Your Tool** | [@YourUsername](https://github.com/YourUsername) | [Link to Your Repo](url) | `tags` |
    ```
4.  **Submit a Pull Request.**

I will review your port to ensure the colors match the design system. If they do, I will merge it, and you will be part of the constellation.
