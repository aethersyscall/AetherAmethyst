## 🔮 The Philosophy

I built **AetherAmethyst** because I was tired of "random" syntax highlighting. Most themes treat code like a bag of Skittles—red strings, green functions, yellow keywords. It creates visual noise that forces your brain to constantly context-switch.

I believe in **Cognitive Color Mapping**. By restricting the entire palette to a specific slice of the spectrum (Violet/Pink/Cyan), I reduce eye strain and create a subconscious "pattern matching" effect.

*   **Logic is cool.** (Blue-Violets represent structure).
*   **Action is hot.** (Neon Pinks represent functions that *do* things).
*   **Data is soft.** (Rose/Lilac represents strings and values).

When you use this theme, you aren't just looking at colors; you are feeling the flow of the code.

## 🌗 The Environments

I designed two distinct variants. They aren't just "inverted" versions of each other; they are chemically different environments meant to evoke specific mental states.

### 🌑 Variant 1: Eclipse (The Void)
**For the night owl.**
I didn't want a "black" screen. Pure black smears on OLEDs and feels claustrophobic. Instead, **Eclipse** uses a deep, desaturated Indigo (`#13111B`). It feels like looking into deep water or the night sky.

*   ** The Vibe:** Bioluminescence in the deep ocean.
*   ** The Palette:** High-contrast neon pastels that "glow" against the void.

### 🌸 Variant 2: Bliss (The Dream)
**For the morning clarity.**
Light themes are usually too harsh (pure white) or too yellow (sepia). **Bliss** is different. It mimics the color of a fresh sheet of lavender-tinted paper (`#FDF7FF`) in bright sunlight.

*   ** The Vibe:** A royal manuscript or a crisp spring morning.
*   ** The Palette:** Deep, saturated Jewel Tones (Amethyst, Plum, Royal Violet) to ensure text is sharp and readable without hurting your eyes.

I cannot build this universe alone. This is where **you** come in.

I have designed the [Design System and the Palette](https://aethersyscall.github.io/AetherAmethyst), but I need you to bring it to your favorite tools. Whether you use VS Code, Emacs, Terminal, or Slack—if you port it, I will list you here as the official Maintainer for that platform.
